### **Why you just created another bicycle?**
Pro-JS is not a bicycle, it is a JS-framework!

---

### **Why you created another JS-framework?**
We are interested in creating reusable components and your own framework is the best way to test how good you are in this development aspect.

---

### **Can I use another JS-framework with Pro-JS?**
Yes, you can use any Pro-JS module independently (for HTTP-requests, dynamic HTML loading, observable components, code units with DI or other useful stuff) or instead of any other JS-framework.

---

### **Why all Pro-JS module's names are 4 characters in length?**
> 0) The same name's length for all modules is a beatiful game for your imagination and grey part of your head. Are you in?

> 1) We believe 1-3 characters words set is not enough for highly extendable framework; 

> 2) 5-characters and more are too many to remember and keep in memory;

### **Is this alternative of JQuery library?**
No. This framework provides a tiny interface for HTML elements querying (which is only a small part of all possibilities) and allows you do not depend on JQuery in most of situations. But we believe we do not need to create another `JQuery`.

---

### **Do you have own Javascript file loader like CommonJS, RequireJS?**
Answer is the same as for JQuery - NO. CommonJS/RequireJS/other file loader make its stuff pretty well and we believe you do not need to learn and master another alternative.
